# Multinational Retail Data Centralisation

A scenario based project as part of the Data Engineering bootcamp by AiCore.

Scenario:

    You work for a multinational company that sells various goods across the globe.

    Currently, their sales data is spread across many different data sources making it not easily accessible or analysable by current members of the team.

    In an effort to become more data-driven, your organisation would like to make its sales data accessible from one centralised location.

    Your first goal will be to produce a system that stores the current company data in a database so that it's accessed from one centralised location and acts as a single source of truth for sales data.

    You will then query the database to get up-to-date metrics for the business.

## Milestone 2 - Data Extraction and Data Cleaning

- Data was extracted from multiple sources, such as Relational Database Tables, API Keys, S3 buckets, PDFs
- The extracted data was then cleaned using pandas and numpy and then uploaded to the local database

## Milestone 3 - Database Queries

- Created multiple queries to update the data types of columns in each table
- Added primary keys and foreign keys

## Milestone 4 - Data Querying

- Created multiple queries to analyse the data in the tables and get information regarding the scenarios given

## What I learned

- Extracting data from multiple sources
- Data cleaning using pandas
- Uploading the cleaned data into a local database
- Writing queries to update data types, to add primary and foreign keys
- Working with datetime in PostgreSQL
- Writing queries to aggregate different parts of multiple tables
