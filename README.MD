# Multinational Retail Data Centralisation

A scenario based project as part of the Data Engineering bootcamp by AiCore.

Scenario:

    You work for a multinational company that sells various goods across the globe.

    Currently, their sales data is spread across many different data sources making it not easily accessible or analysable by current members of the team.

    In an effort to become more data-driven, your organisation would like to make its sales data accessible from one centralised location.

    Your first goal will be to produce a system that stores the current company data in a database so that it's accessed from one centralised location and acts as a single source of truth for sales data.

    You will then query the database to get up-to-date metrics for the business.

## Milestone 2 - Data extraction and data cleaning

- Data was extracted from multiple sources, such as Relational Database Tables, API Keys, S3 buckets, PDFs
- The extracted data was then cleaned and uploaded to the local database

## Milestone 3 - Database schema

- created multiple schemas to update the data types of columns in each table
- added primary keys and foreign keys

## What I learned

- Extracting data from multiple sources
- Data cleaning using pandas
- Uploading the cleaned data into a local database
- Writing SQL schemas to update data types, to add primary and foreign keys
